# AWACS Dashboard platform

AWACS is written in Java, using the [Play! framework](http://www.playframework.org/). A few notes on Play! based applications:

* Java files are compiled on the fly â€” you can edit and change files without starting/stopping or recompiling the application.
* The "app" directory of the application or its modules contains executed code.
* Modules are basically miniature Play! applications which can be transparently grafted into a another application: they can have their own 'app', 'lib', etc and those paths are simply searched after the main application's paths when loading files.

A few notes on the dashboard application:

* The app uses its database to store _WidgetInstances_ which are a specific configurations of a _Widget_
* A _Dashboard_ is a collection of WidgetInstances, arranged in columns, optionally with parameters specific to that dashboard (stored as an _Assignment)_.
* Bundles of widgets are packaged as Play! modules so that company-specific widgets are kept separate from distributed widgets.
* The main app has a few "raw" widgets builtin for rendering HTML or Images.
* A _Widget_ is Java class which implements the Widget interface, contained within a package in the _widgets_ package of the application or an added module.
* A Widget can include CSS and JS files in its package directory, to be linked in the `<head>` of any pages which include an instance of it.
* A Widget controls rendering of its HTML and can setup AJAX/JSON end-points to do server-side processing.

## Example Download / Install Play!

Use your package manager or see Play! documentation for more up-to-date examples, but as of writing, this was one option:

	curl -O "http://download.playframework.org/releases/play-1.0.3.1.zip"
	unzip play-1.0.3.1.zip
	sudo cp -r play-1.0.3.1 /usr/local/play
	rm play-1.0.3.1.zip
	echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/usr/local/play" >> ~/.profile
	source ~/.profile
	play

## Browse Installed Widgets

`http://localhost:9000/widgets` displays a gallery of installed widgets as well configured instances, along with links to the sandbox to play with them.

Appending `?repair=all` to gallery will delete orphaned instances who's providing widget code is no longer available.

Appending `?rescan=all` to the gallery will freshen the widget cache.

## Adding Widget Bundles

Checkout widget module(s) and add to the application. For example:

	cd ~/dashboard
	git clone <path-to-awacs-widgets-local>
	echo "module.awacs-widgets-local=`pwd`/awacs-widgets-local" >> awacs/conf/application.conf

# Making a Simple Widget

	mkdir sandbox && cd sandbox
	/path/to/awacs/examples/widget.sh
	cp -r <package> <widget bundle>/app/widgets/<package>

# Testing a Widget

When developing a widget, a simple action is available to render a specific widget for testing without needing to create a WidgetInstance or add it to a Dashboard:

	http://localhost:9000/sandbox/{className}/{configString}

# About Widgets

* Rendering HTML

  When rendering a widget, the dashboard will call the `render` method of the widget to generate HTML. `BaseWidget`'s implementation will search first for a .html file with the same name as the widget class, then for `widget.html`, in the widget's package.
In the example widget `mywidget.MyClass` and `mywidget.SomeClass` will both render from `mywidget/widget.html` while `mywidget.OtherClass` with render from `mywidget/OtherClass.html`

* JS and CSS resources

  The dashboard will check every widget on a given dashboard for `behavior.js` and `styles.css` before rendering a dashboard. If found, these are linked in the `<head>` tag, and are served using `/styles/<WidgetPackageName>.css` and `/scripts/<WidgetPackageName>.js`. In the example widget `/styles/mywidget.css` and `/scripts/mywidget.js`.

* AJAX callbacks

  The method `endpoint(endpointName, params)` of a widget is invoked by the dashboard to reply to requests made to `/endpoint/<widgetPackage>.<WidgetClass>/<endpointName>`. The `Object` it returns is rendered to the client as JSON using `Gson().toJson()`.
In the example, an a request to `/endpoint/mywidget.MyClass/getDataPoints` which would result in a call to `mywidget.MyClass("getDataPoints", params)`. See the Play! docs for details on the `params` argument, but it exposes request parameters.

* Available Javascript Methods:

  * `Dashboard.register(somethingToRun)`: Drop this in a widget's HTML, and _somethingToRun_'s `start()` method will be called after everything has loaded. The Dashboard will start widgets gradually to maintain performance.
  * `Dashboard.warn(message)`: displays _message_ to the user briefly (i.e. an ajax call timed out).
  * `Dashboard.fatal(message)`: displays _message_ and reloads the dashboard. _Use this only when recovery from an error is not likely_ (i.e. malformed JSON indicates potential version change).

### Example Widget Bundle
